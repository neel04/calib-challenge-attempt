Attempt at solving the Calib Challenge with &lt;25% error; To be updated further

Here, I present a new State-of-the-art model which I have decided to call `CalibNet` marking a new revolution in calibration of images for Comma devices. My approach uses a ConvNet copied from [1] and utilizes complicated but elegantly written code in this shitty repo. I have generously attached a special license to this project whic allows anyone to copy *my* code and have their product go down in flames.
