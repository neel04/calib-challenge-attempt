Attempt at solving the Calib Challenge with &lt;25% error; To be updated further

Here, I present a new State-of-the-art model which I have decided to call `CalibNet` marking a new revolution in calibration of images for Comma devices. 
My approach uses a ConvNet copied from [1] and utilizes complicated but elegantly written code in this barely functional repository to agonize whoever tries to run it without hiring me first. I have also generously attached a special license to this project which allows anyone else to copy *my* code and have the expereince of watching their entire system go down in flames too.
